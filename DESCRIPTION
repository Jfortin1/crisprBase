Description: Provides S4 classes for general nucleases and CRISPR nucleases.
    Several CRISPR-specific genome arithmetic functions are implemented to
    help extract genomic coordinates of spacer and protospacer sequences. 
    Commonly-used CRISPR nuclease objects are provided that can be readily
    used in other packages.
