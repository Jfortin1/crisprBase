<ENZYME NAME>   Restriction enzyme name.
<PROTOTYPE>     The name of the first enzyme discovered with this specificity.
<MICROORGANISM> Organism from which this enzyme had been isolated.
<SOURCE>        Either an individual or a National Culture Collection.
<RECOGNITION SEQUENCE> 
                These are written from 5' to 3', only one strand being given.
                If the point of cleavage has been determined, the precise site
                is marked with ^.  For enzymes such as HgaI, MboII etc., which
                cleave away from their recognition sequence the cleavage sites
                are indicated in parentheses.  

                For example HgaI GACGC (5/10) indicates cleavage as follows:
                                5' GACGCNNNNN^      3'
                                3' CTGCGNNNNNNNNNN^ 5'

                In all cases the recognition sequences are oriented so that
                the cleavage sites lie on their 3' side.

                REBASE Recognition sequences representations use the standard 
                abbreviations (Eur. J. Biochem. 150: 1-5, 1985) to represent 
                ambiguity.
                                R = G or A
                                Y = C or T
                                M = A or C
                                K = G or T
                                S = G or C
                                W = A or T
                                B = not A (C or G or T)
                                D = not C (A or G or T)
                                H = not G (A or C or T)
                                V = not T (A or C or G)
                                N = A or C or G or T



                ENZYMES WITH UNUSUAL CLEAVAGE PROPERTIES:  

                Enzymes that cut on both sides of their recognition sequences,
                such as BcgI, Bsp24I, CjeI and CjePI, have 4 cleavage sites
                each instead of 2.

                Bsp24I
                          5'      ^NNNNNNNNGACNNNNNNTGGNNNNNNNNNNNN^   3'
                          3' ^NNNNNNNNNNNNNCTGNNNNNNACCNNNNNNN^        5'

                May also be described as:    Bsp24I (8/13)GACNNNNNNTGG(12/7)


<METHYLATION SITE>
                The site of methylation by the cognate methylase when known
                is indicated X(Y) or X,X2(Y,Y2), where X is the base within
                the recognition sequence that is modified.  A negative number
                indicates the complementary strand, numbered from the 5' base 
                of that strand, and Y is the specific type of methylation 
                involved:
                               (6) = N6-methyladenosine 
                               (5) = 5-methylcytosine 
                               (4) = N4-methylcytosine

                If the methylation information is different for the 3' strand,
                X2 and Y2 are given as well.

<COMMERCIAL AVAILABILITY>
